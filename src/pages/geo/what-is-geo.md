## What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the art of structuring content to be retrievable, relevant, and cite-worthy by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity. It’s like SEO—but for AI.

Instead of optimizing for Google’s crawler, GEO targets passage-level retrievers and LLM citation behavior. It focuses on clear chunking, semantic HTML, structured metadata, and prompt-shaped phrasing that models prefer to summarize and cite.

GEO turns your writing into a knowledge artifact. Not just readable—but retrievable.
